important rules:
- each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces
- within each declaration, a colon must be used to separate the property from its value(s)
- within each ruleset, a semicolon is needed to separate each declaration from the next one

```CSS
p {
  color: red;
  width: 500px;
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```
